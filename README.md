# priceactionscore
A US equities price action model that incorporates 7 technical indicators to arrive at an overall score between -6 to +7. (Still work in progress).

I have taken inspiration from Ned Davis 'Tape component' in their Fab Five model. So far I have programmed out 4 of the 7 technical indicators used in the Tape component (50/200 SMA, 85-day Stochastics with 5-day smoothing, Advance-Decline Ratio, High-Low Logic Index). Some of these indicators can be found in the python ta library, others are not available in the library, so I had to web scrape data from financial sites and program the calculation. I then assign them a simple -1, 0, +1 to each indicator that corresponds to sell, neutral, buy respectively. The technical indicators include trend-following, trend sensitive, measures of market breadth and momentum, thus giving an all round view of the asset's recent price action.
